            <h1>Generic Font Family</h1>
            <p>A generic font family in CSS is a fallback font category that represents a broad class of fonts. It ensures that if a specific font is not available on a user's device or browser, the browser will default to a similar font within that generic family. There are five generic font families in CSS:</p>
            
            <h3>serif</h3>
            <p>- Fonts with decorative strokes at the ends of characters, often used for traditional and formal designs. Examples include Times New Roman, Georgia, and Palatino.</p>
            <p>- For example: Lucida Bright, Lucida Fax, Palatino, Palatino Linotype, Palladio, URW Palladio</p>
            
            <h3>sans-serif</h3>
            <p>- Fonts without decorative strokes, known for their clean and modern appearance. Common examples include Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana.</p>
            <p>- For example: Open Sans, Fira Sans, Lucida Sans, Lucida Sans Unicode, Trebuchet MS, Liberation Sans, Nimbus Sans L</p>
            
            <h3>monospace</h3>
            <p>- Fonts where each character occupies the same amount of horizontal space, often used for code snippets or typewriter-style text. Examples include Courier New, Consolas, and Monaco.</p>
            <p>- For example: Fira Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, Menlo, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Monaco, Lucida Console</p>
            
            <h3>cursive</h3>
            <p>- Fonts that mimic handwriting or calligraphy, adding a more personalized touch to text. Examples include Comic Sans MS, Brush Script, and Snell Roundhand.</p>
            <p>- For example: Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, Lucida Calligraphy, Lucida Handwriting, Apple Chancery</p>
            
            <h3>fantasy</h3>
            <p>- Fonts that don't fit into the other categories, often unique or decorative in style. They are typically used for special effects or artistic purposes. Examples include Impact, Papyrus, and Chalkboard.</p>
            <p>- For example: Papyrus, Herculanum, Party LET, Curlz MT, Harrington</p>
